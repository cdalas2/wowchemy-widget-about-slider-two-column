## üåà Add the Widget to your Site

1. Install the widget by referencing it in your `config/_defaults/config.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   module:
     imports:
       - path: github.com/cdalas2/wowchemy-widget-about-slider-two-column
   ```
   
2. Create an instance of your widget in `content/home/`, for example let's create `content/home/github.cdalas2.about-avatar-caption.md`:
```markdown
---
# An instance of the About Slider Two Column widget.
# Documentation: https://wowchemy.com/docs/page-builder/
widget: github.cdalas2.about-slider-two-column

# Activate this widget? true/false
active: true

# This file represents a page section.
headless: true

# Order that this section appears on the page.
weight: 1

design:
  # Slide height is automatic unless you force a specific height (e.g. '400px')
  slide_height: ''
  is_fullscreen: true
  # Automatically transition through slides?
  loop: true
  # Duration of transition between slides (in ms)
  interval: 3000
